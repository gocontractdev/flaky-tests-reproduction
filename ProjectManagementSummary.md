## üìù Project Management Summary

Division of Labor:

This re-creation work has been handled by Amir Reza Javaher Dashti
under supervision of Professor Ralf L√§mmel.

#### Followings are some general notes and practices followed during this work:

1- Use of Virtual Environment:

Since the original work was written in Python,
we have also continued to use Python. Hence, we have taken advantage of Python's Virtual Environment to keep
the separation between the actual runtime system of the users and the requirements needed to run this project.
I have also committed the environment for the ease of use.

2- Organization issue:
The whole original work is poorly organized. It makes it difficult to locate where each file, folder or output is located; thus, just
 organizing the repository was a challenge of its own.

3- Dealing with lack of 1 team member:
